# python_platformer
A video game programmed using pygame Made using Python 3.11

The game consists of 2 levels. All with their own enemies, music and obstacles. The game ends after completing the 2nd level. 
This was a personal project made to showcase and practice my ability to use Object Oriented Programming. Some portions and features were intentionally left out since this was not meant to be a complete game. 

Features include:

Pausing,
Double Jump,
Wall Jump,
Coin Collecting,
Item Collecting,
Manual BG Parallax
