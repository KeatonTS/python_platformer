# python_platformer
A video game programmed using pygame Made using Python 3.11

Did not include the asset files as there are too many to upload and they contain personal characters. The game consists of 3 levels. All with their own enemies, music and obstacles. The game ends after completing the 3rd level. 

This was a personal project made to showcase and practice my ability to use Object Oriented Programming. Some portions and features were intentionally left out since this was not meant to be a complete game. 

Features include:

Pausing,
Double Jump,
Wall Jump,
Coin Collecting,
Item Collecting,
BG Parallax
